        Part 3 begins two to three years after the Royal Mint of Spain Heist,
        showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations.
        However, when Europol captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the
        Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the Bank of Spain to
        force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture. He and Raquel
        (going by "Lisbon") get the gang, including Mónica (going by
        "Stockholm"), back together and enlist three new members: Bogotá,
        Palermo and Marseille, with Palermo in charge. 
        Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different
        approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded
        bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state
        secrets, while the Professor and Lisbon travel in an RV and then an
        ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach
        in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo
        and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers.
        Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted sniper shot in the
        chest, and Lisbon is caught by the police. With another police assault
        on the bank incoming, and believing Lisbon to have been executed by the
        police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares DEFCON 2 on the
        police. 
        Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and
        Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap and that
        "the war had begun."
